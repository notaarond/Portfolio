# My Small Work Collection !

Some PCB Projects I've done:

- Breakout Board for a TPS3702 Voltage Watchdog Chip
- The "Powerboard":  A Power Hub PCB with 3 Voltage Regulators and Headers for Each
- Sprinkle: ESP-32 based Avionics Board for a 2-Stage Rocket (currently still in progress)
  - not my original design, but was handed over to me minimize and add new sensors, test points, and storage systems.

Projects done in Altium or Kicad 7 :)
